    <p>Lasagna, a comfort food for many may be rather time consuming to make. 
        But, I promise, the effort will be well worth it.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef - 
            We used 80/20 beef (20% fat content) for a juicier lasagna
        </li>
        <li>Onion and garlic - 
            Yellow onion or sweet onion works well with 4 garlic cloves.
        </li>
        <li>Marinara sauce -
            Homemade marinara or store bought
        </li>
        <li>Sugar -
            Reduces the acidity of the tomatoes and enhance sweetness
        </li>
        <li>Spices and Seasonings - 
            Basil, oregano, dried thyme and parsley
        </li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles -
            Dried lasagna sheets or homemade noodles
        </li>
        <li>Cheese - 
            Cottage, ricotta and mozarella
        </li>
        <li>Eggs - 
            2 eggs to hold the layers together upon cutting
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Brown the beef - 
            Add oil to a deep pan and sautee onion and beef until browned, 
            5 minutes then add garlic and stir another minute.
        </li>
        <li>Finish the sauce - 
            Pour in 1/4 cup of wine and stir until almost evaporated. 
            Add marinara, salt, pepper, thyme, sugar, and parsley; 
            bring to a simmer, then cover and cook 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the cheese filling -
            Combine all of the cheese sauce ingredients and 1 cup of mozzarella 
            in a mixing bowl (reserve the rest for later).
        </li>
        <li>Prep -
            Preheat your oven to 375ºF and cook the lasagna noodles 
            in a pot of well-salted water until al dente.
        </li>
        <li>Assemble -
            Spread 1/2 cup of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch 
            casserole dish. Add 3 noodles, followed by 1/3 of the meat sauce, 
            1 cup of mozzarella, and half of the ricotta mixture. Repeat, 
            then for the top layer, add 3 noodles, 1/3 of the meat sauce, 
            and the remaining mozzarella.
        </li>
        <li>Bake -
            Cover with foil and bake at 375˚F for 45 minutes, then remove the 
            foil and broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese is lightly browned.
        </li>
        <li>Rest -
            Let the lasagna rest for about 30 minutes before cutting and serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
